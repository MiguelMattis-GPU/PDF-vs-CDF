# PDF-vs-CDF
The PDF ( probability density function) is a probability law for a continuous random variable say X ( for discrete, it is probability mass function). The probability law defines the chances of the random variable taking a particular value say x, i.e. P (X=x). However this definition is not valid for continuous random variables because the probability at a given point is zero. An alternate to this is: pdf= P (x-e&lt;X&lt;=x)/e as e tends to zero. The CDF ( Cumulative Distribution Function) as the name cumulative suggests, is simply the probability upto a particular value of the random variable, say x. Generally denoted by F, F= P (X&lt;=x) for any value of x in the X space. It is defined for both discrete and continuous random variables.
